## Why the massive EASYRSA_CA_EXPIRE and EASYRSA_CERT_EXPIRE values in vars?

We lean on SSL for encryption only, and authenticate endpoints using OpenVPN's auth script integration, controllable for Servers via UUID's, blacklists, whitelists and discovery mode, and for Users via their User object properties (user/pass and is_active).

We hope that humanity has moved on from this tool and from SSL VPN's in general within the next century. IPv4 will likely still be around though ðŸ˜­
